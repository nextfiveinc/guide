## What is Guide?

Guide is a complete productivity system packed into a **single HTML file**. It runs entirely in your browser, and all your data is stored locally on your machine. There are no accounts, no servers, and no tracking. Your data is 100% yours.

Listen: It's a glorified To-Do list. But then again, it's So. Much. More.

It's designed for those of us who want a powerful, private tool that goes beyond the simple to-do list. It combines goal-oriented task management with unique "Playbooks" to help you navigate the common mental hurdles of productivity—like feeling blocked, bored, or stressed.

_[**NOTE**]: Some optional features depend on AI, which are disabled by default. And you can either choose to use your local models or not use them at all. But should you choose to use your API for cloud based AI providers such as Anthropic or Google or OpenAI, some of your data will be sent to your selected providers for the features to work._


## Core Philosophies

*  Set your goals. As many as you want - but we suggest keep no more than 4-5 larger ones to remain focussed.
*  No more than 1 active, i.e, Primary goal at a time; For larger goals - say, lose 10 kg weight - we suggest you keep it active for a month.
*  Tasks should be connected to Goals. We do not enforce it, but we strongly recommend you do; You can do it in just 2-clicks.
*  No more than 3 tasks at a time. We suggest, just complete 3 tasks for the entire day.
*  Build and follow routines. That way, you don't have to think "what next". Lowers friction.
*  Use playbooks for when you get blocked. Or stressed. You can customize these with what works for you.
*  We all get bored. Take a break. Ask Guide for some fun options (no AI needed).
*  Keep your most important References and Reminders handy, right within Guide. Such as - "why did I want to lose weight in the first place...".  To help yourself with your Routines / Playbooks and on remain on track.
*  Offline first. Cross-platform. No blobs; just single HTML file.


## Why Use Guide?

*   **🧠 Holistic productivity**: It's not just about what you do, but how you feel. The integrated **Blocked, Bored, and Stressed Playbooks** provide interactive guides and tips to get you back on track when your mental state is the real bottleneck.
*   **🤖 Smart AI assistance**: Leverage the power of modern AI to break down complex tasks, brainstorm next steps for your goals, or get insights into your own productivity patterns. It supports multiple providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek or use locally served models) and you use your **own API key**, ensuring your data remains private.
*   **🔒 Private & Offline-First**: All data lives and dies in your browser's local storage. Nothing is ever sent to a server. This makes it incredibly fast, reliable offline, and completely private.
*   **🔧 Fully Customizable & Portable**: You can edit, import, or export your data for the built-in Playbooks to tailor them to your personal strategies. The full application backup feature allows you to take your entire workspace with you to any device with a web browser.

## How to Use

This is the best part. There is no installation.

1.  **Download** the `guide.html` file.
2.  **Open** it in any modern web browser - on your desktop or your mobile. Tested on Chrome on Android and Firefox / Chrome on Desktop.
3.  That was it, actually!

 The app is now running. You can bookmark the page for easy access. All your data will be saved automatically in that browser.

 On the 1st run, **Guide offers a streamlined, 2-step process to import demo data**. This allows new users to explore the features with pre-filled content immediately, rather than facing a blank screen.
 Strongly suggest you give it a go - takes less than 5 mins.

**Important note on data**: Because your data is stored in the browser, it is tied to that specific browser on that specific computer. To use the app on another machine or to prevent data loss, be sure to use the **Settings > Backup & Restore > Export Full Backup** feature regularly.
